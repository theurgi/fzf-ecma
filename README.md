# fzf-ecma

fzf-ecma is a monorepo containing JavaScript bindings (with TypeScript support)
for the popular golang [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) fuzzy finder. It
currently includes implementations for [Bun](https://bun.sh/) and
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

**Why wrap a golang library? Why not rewrite it in JavaScript?**

1. That would take a lot of work
2. fzf is _Blazingly fast_ ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
3. fzf is very well maintained

> Note: All packages in this repository require fzf to be installed on your
> system and available in your PATH.

## Packages

See each packages's README for specific installation and usage details.

## Basic usage

Simply provide `fzf` with an array of strings and an array of fzf options. When
this script is executed, it will spawn fzf as a child process in your SHELL. For
all available fzf options see the [fzf docs](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf).

```ts
import { fzf } from 'fzf-bun'

// Run `man fzf` in your shell to see all available fzf options
const fzfOptions = ['--multi', '--preview-window=up', '--preview', 'echo {}']

const selections = ['Pen ‚úíÔ∏è', 'Pineapple üçç', 'Apple üçé', 'Pen ‚úíÔ∏è']

const selection = await fzf(selections, fzfOptions)

// Do something with selection
console.log(selection)
```
